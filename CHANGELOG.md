## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- `BillingManager` (`Billing` facade) — `extend()`/`driver()`/`gateways()`/`gateway()`, `charge()`/`chargeWithMethod()` orchestration, `resolveChargeAmount()` for currency-aware pricing.
- Built-in gateways: **LiqPay**, **WayForPay**, **Monobank Acquiring**, **Stripe**, **Hutko** — registered automatically, credentials read from `config('billing.gateways.*')` by default. `fake` gateway (local/testing only) for testing the full flow without a real bank account.
- `PaymentGatewayContract` (required) and optional capability contracts — `RefundsPayments`, `ChecksPaymentStatus`, `TokenizesPaymentMethod`, `SubscriptionGatewayContract`, `HasReceiptItems` — for writing your own gateway driver.
- `AbstractGateway` base class and `WebhookConfigRegistrar` helper to cut driver boilerplate to a minimum.
- Domain models: `Payment`, `Plan`, `Price`, `Subscription`, `PaymentMethod` — one-time payments and subscriptions (trials, flat/licensed/metered pricing, usage quotas) in the same package.
- Webhook pipeline on top of `spatie/laravel-webhook-client` — signature verification, idempotent processing, and a consistent set of events (`PaymentSucceeded`, `PaymentFailed`, `PaymentRefunded`, `SubscriptionCreated`, `SubscriptionRenewed`, `SubscriptionPaymentFailed`, `SubscriptionCancelled`, `SubscriptionPaused`, `SubscriptionResumed`, `TrialWillEnd`, `PaymentMethodAttached`, `PaymentMethodDetached`, `UsageLimitReached`).
- `CredentialResolverContract` and `CurrencyConverterContract` — bind your own implementation for dynamic per-tenant credentials or multi-currency pricing.
- Artisan commands (off by default, `billing.schedule.enabled`): `billing:process-recurring-charges`, `billing:reconcile-pending-payments`, `billing:expire-trials`.
- Manual/offline payments (cash, bank transfer) supported without a gateway driver — create a `Payment` row directly with `status: paid`.
